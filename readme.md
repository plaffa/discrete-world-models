Implementation not to be confused with 
'Deep Neuroevolution of Recurrent and Discrete World Models' (Risi et al. 2019)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08857



1. Train VQ-VAE with RGB or semantic segmentation
2. Extract latent codes
3. Train RNN with RGB or semantic segmentation
4. Predict video with RNN
